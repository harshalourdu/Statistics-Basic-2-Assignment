    "# Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean – The arithmetic average of a dataset, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "Median – The middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "Mode – The value that occurs most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "Mean: The average value of the dataset. It is used when the data is symmetrically distributed and is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "Median: The middle value that separates the dataset into two equal halves. It is often used when the dataset has outliers or is skewed.\n",
    "Mode: The value that appears most frequently. It is particularly useful for categorical data and identifying the most common item in the dataset.\n",

    "# Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values. It gives an idea of how spread out the values are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It measures the spread of the data but in squared units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, it provides a measure of spread in the same units as the data.\n",

    "# Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    "A Venn diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between different sets. It uses overlapping circles to show which elements are shared between sets and which are unique to each set.\n",

    "# Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness refers to the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive skew (right skew): The right tail is longer, meaning the mean is greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative skew (left skew): The left tail is longer, meaning the mean is less than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q9. If a data is right skewed, what will be the position of the median with respect to the mean?\n",
    "In a right-skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, so the mean is located to the right of the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase together, while a negative covariance indicates that one variable increases as the other decreases.\n",
    "Correlation standardizes covariance to provide a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q12. For a normal distribution data, what is the relationship between its measures of central tendency?\n",
    "In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and lie at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables but does not provide a standardized scale.\n",
    "Correlation standardizes the covariance, providing a measure of both the strength and direction of the linear relationship, with values between -1 and +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can skew the mean, making it higher or lower than the central cluster of data. The median is less sensitive to outliers because it depends on the middle value. Dispersion measures like variance and standard deviation can also be greatly affected by outliers.\n",
